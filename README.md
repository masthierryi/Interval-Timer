Interval Timer. Just a ultra clean and elegant interval timer.

Motivation: Most interval timers available for PCs are ugly, not very functional, and not very customizable, so I created my own. It's still far from perfect, but for now it will be very useful. To make changes you may need to understand a little bit of Python programming.

Please note: The actual main file is a python file, so you will need it and the tkinter package installed on your PC.

Future implementations:
  - Add a button for customizing timings and timer setups interactively (not in the code);
  - Add maximize and minimize buttons
  - Turn it into an .exe file (Idk how to do it yet).

If you have any suggestions or comment, please leave them on the discussion page.
